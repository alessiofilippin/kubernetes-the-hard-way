# Provisioning Pod Network Routes

Pods scheduled to a node receive an IP address from the node's Pod CIDR range. At this point pods can not communicate with other pods running on different nodes due to missing network [routes](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc/routes).

In this lab you will create a route for each worker node that maps the node's Pod CIDR range to the node's internal IP address.

> There are [other ways](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#how-to-achieve-this) to implement the Kubernetes networking model.

## The Routing Table

If you followed the steps from [Provisioning Compute Resources](02-compute-resources.md), the routing table should be already present.
